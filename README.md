Today I explored Go interfaces, methods, and pointers.

### What's New:
* **Animal Zoo**: Implemented polymorphism using the `Speaker` interface for different entities.
* **Banking System**: Updated with a `Payer` interface, supporting Credit Cards, Cash, and Crypto payments with real balance-update logic.
* **Logic & Pointers**: Used pointer receivers to ensure data persistence and added custom error handling for failed transactions.

Built with fresh logic and better performance! :)
